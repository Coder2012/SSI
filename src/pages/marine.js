      <p>
        For inshore inspection, we deploy our diver support teams who assist
        divers to inspect the condition of underwater structure. Our divers
        along with the support teams are able to take sludge samples, perform
        drilling or visually inspect the structure of the object. Specialized
        equipment gauges wall thickness and other materials are at their
        disposal, support teams and divers capture the all surveys with
        underwater cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
        All support teams and our divers have the necessary skills and
        experience when conditions of the structures in often limited- or
        zero-visibility conditions when Non-Destructive methods are required.{' '}
